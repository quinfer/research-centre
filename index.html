<h1>About</h1>
<p>The <em>Financial technology and Analytics laB</em> (hereafter FAB) is a cross-disciplinary research institute based at Queen’s Management School. The lab will be industry-focused and aims to provide thought leadership for Northern Ireland’s vibrant financial technology ecosystem<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<section id="mission" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mission">Mission</h2>
<p>The mission is to bridge gaps between information technologies, data science, innovation, and financial decision-making. Our goal is to be a global lab of excellence, uniquely located at the gateway between the US, the UK, and the EU.</p>
<p>To achieve this mission the lab has the following strategic goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nuclei industry clusters for disruptive thought leadership in the areas of FinTech;</li>
<li>Strengthen and develop linkages with Queen’s Centre for Secure Information Technologies and the Global Innovation Institute.</li>
<li>Be a world leader in regulatory technology research<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Actively co-produce academic output with industry partners.</li>
<li>Foster international partnerships with other research labs in financial technology and data science.</li>
<li>Up-skill and re-skill the workforce using research-led postgraduate qualifications.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="rationale" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>The financial services industry has witnessed a rapid expansion in the use of algorithms which has coincided with the expansion of the technology solutions in highly regulated business sectors <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The largest drivers of digitalisation in business are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Resilience-focused regulations in US, EU &amp; UK;</li>
<li>Cloud migration for business agility and ESG benefits;</li>
<li>Cyber security, risk and privacy;</li>
<li>AI and machine learning adoption.</li>
</ol>
<p>The trends in digitising finance were facilitated by the growth of hybrid cloud and advances in digital automation. The former requires secure connectivity and the latter intelligent application with risk controls. The current wave of outsourcing regulations is targeted toward the operational resilience of the partnership between the technology providers and adopting financial institution.</p>
<p>These trends will necessitate an agile research ecosystem which provides synergistic intelligence across, computer science, risk analytics, and the rule of law. As such, there is a need for a global centre of excellence to set standards, disperse best practices, examine competence, and ensure the industry is aligned to the objectives of lawmakers.</p>

In the past twenty years, financial institutions increased their spend on compliance and oversight from 1-2% of revenues to around 5%.
