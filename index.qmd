# About

The *Financial technology and Analytics laB* (hereafter FAB) is a cross-disciplinary research institute based at Queen's Management School. The lab will be industry-focused and aims to provide thought leadership for Northern Ireland's vibrant financial technology ecosystem[^1].

[^1]: An overview of this ecosystem can be found here: <https://fintechnorthernireland.com/fintech-ecosystem/>

## Mission

The mission is to bridge gaps between information technologies, data science, innovation, and financial decision-making. Our goal is to be a global lab of excellence, uniquely located at the gateway between the US, the UK, and the EU.

To achieve this mission the lab has the following strategic goals:

1.  Nuclei industry clusters for disruptive thought leadership in the areas of FinTech;
2.  Strengthen and develop linkages with Queen's Centre for Secure Information Technologies and the Global Innovation Institute.
3.  Be a world leader in regulatory technology research[^2].
4.  Actively co-produce academic output with industry partners.
5.  Foster international partnerships with other research labs in financial technology and data science.
6.  Up-skill and re-skill the workforce using research-led postgraduate qualifications.

[^2]: Regulatory technology (RegTech) is the use of information technology to enhance regulatory and compliance processes. Since 2015, it has been identified as a strategic priority for the UK financial services sector (<https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fintech-blackett-review>).

## Rationale

The financial services industry has witnessed a rapid expansion in the use of algorithms which has coincided with the expansion of the technology solutions in highly regulated business sectors [^3].

[^3]: For instances, the financial sector has faced a vast expansion in outsourcing, partly in response to the financial crisis. In the past twenty years, financial institutions increased their spend on compliance and oversight from 1-2% of revenues to around 5%. This led to a desire to reduce the financial impact, and hence a growth in outsourcing.

The largest drivers of digitalisation in business are:

1.  Resilience-focused regulations in US, EU & UK;
2.  Cloud migration for business agility and ESG benefits;
3.  Cyber security, risk and privacy;
4.  AI and machine learning adoption.

The trends in digitising finance were facilitated by the growth of hybrid cloud and advances in digital automation. The former requires secure connectivity and the latter intelligent application with risk controls. The current wave of outsourcing regulations is targeted toward the operational resilience of the partnership between the technology providers and adopting financial institution.

These trends will necessitate an agile research ecosystem which provides synergistic intelligence across, computer science, risk analytics, and the rule of law. As such, there is a need for a global centre of excellence to set standards, disperse best practices, examine competence, and ensure the industry is aligned to the objectives of lawmakers.

# Why FAB in Queen's University Belfast?

-   Northern Ireland is recognised as a world-leading cyber security ecosystem underpinned by QUB's CSIT (Centre for Secure Intelligent Technology) -- the UK's largest cybersecurity-focused university technology partner.

-   Collaborative tertiary education sector with the ability to write bespoke training programmes and provide skills required (albeit lead time is required).

-   Existing core tech capability to be enhanced via Belfast Region City Deals and the overall 10X economic strategy in NI.

-   The unique location gives access to UK and EU markets.

Queen's Management School are uniquely positioned to establish an emerging research lab for financial technology, working in partnership with CSIT, to provide business and financial insights for the digital economy.

# Strategic Aims

We will provide thought leadership within the following multidisciplinary research ecosystem. The first diagram outlines the research expertise of the FAB.

```

A key strategic goal for FAB is to enhance and develop multidisciplinary research through strong links with with [CSIT](http://www.csit.qub.ac.uk). Going forward, the lab is well positioned to feed into the plans by the Belfast City Deal to build a global innovation institute in secure connected intelligence at Queen's. The following diagram highlights expertise linkages (regulatory technology expertise is highlighted in orange):

## Activities

-   Flagship projects to nuclei industry clusters in digital disruptive thought leadership
    1.  UK productivity gap and FinTech NI.

    2.  Regulatory technologies and financial inclusion.
-   Funding opportunities with CSIT from the new Global Innovations Institutes route.
-   Actively engage in corporate sponsorship and collaboration funding projects.
    -   Possibilities for sponsorship for access to expertise, workshops, and lab-affiliated graduates.
-   Industry-sponsored research activities, including PhD-sponsored opportunities and **AI for Good** projects.
-   Establishing a sandbox program to cultivate future-ready graduates by transforming our courses into real-world *sandboxes*, bringing together students, academics, and the industry to co-create solutions for contemporary problems[^4].
-   Fellowship will be awarded to graduate students who complete sandbox projects and who are working on research at the bleeding edge of research.
-   In collaboration with [EEECS](https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/eeecs/), The lab will launch a PG certificate in financial technology and machine learning in 2023, designed specifically to up-skill and re-skill talent for the local fintech industry.

# Funding strategy

FAB aims to be self-sustaining in the long run with some initial start-up funding from the School. The proposed funding strategy will be multifaceted, partnering with national research centres such as the [Hartree centre](https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Partners.aspx) and strategic industry partnerships, and deepening collaborative opportunities with CSIT and ECIT.

# International partnerships possibles

To establish a global presence, the lab will seek out partnerships with other academic research labs with similar expertise. For example
